I am a project scientist affiliated with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. I am interested in physical oceanography and earth system modeling. Currently I am working on improving the tides in GFDL's [ocean model](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/ocean-model/) [MOM6](https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/MOM6).
